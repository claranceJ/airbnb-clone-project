# airbnb-clone-project.
This repo contains the source code and files for the airbnb-clone-project.

# Description.
A booking management system using AirBnb as a case study to give me practical experience in developing booking and management systems.

# Goal.
This goal of this project is to help me develop adequate knowledge and skills to implement any type of system(Prodev).

# Technologies Used.

    Frontend: React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, TailwindCSS for styling.
    Backend: Python, Django, and MySQL (for illustration purposes; the backend is not the primary focus).
    Other Tools: Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration, and Jest for testing.

# UI/UX Design Planning.
The design goal is to have a good booking system that has a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

   # 1. Key features.  
       
       - Property Listings: Display properties with relevant details and images.
       - Booking System: Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
       - Search Functionality: Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).
       - User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.

   # 2. Primary Pages.
   
- PAGE 1( Property Listing View): This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.
